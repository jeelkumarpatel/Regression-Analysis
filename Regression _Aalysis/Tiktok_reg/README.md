# Regression Model

The variable of verified_status was selected for this regression model because of the relationship seen between the verified account type and the video content. A logistic regression model was selected because of the data type and distribution. 

# Model Results

The logistic regression model achieved a precision of 69% and a recall of 66% (weighted averages). This model achieved an f1 accuracy of 66%. These model results inform key insights on video features, discussed in “key insights.”

# Key Insights

Based on the estimated model coefficients from the logistic regression, longer videos tend to be associated with higher odds of the user being verified.

Other video features have small estimated coefficients in the model, so their association with verified status seems to be small. As a result, other video features besides video length do not seem to be associated with verified status.
