# Regression-Analysis

As a data analyst, I have constructed a unique regression model for each company (Automatidata, Tiktok, and Waze), aiming to extract valuable insights and illuminate hidden trends within their data.

# 1) Automatidata EDA Project
Background on the Automatidata scenario: Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs.

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered.

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.

# 2) Tiktok EDA Project
Background on the TikTok scenario: At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, I'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow my career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner.

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

# 3) Waze EDA Project
Background on the Waze scenario: Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.

I have collaborated with Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. My team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn.
